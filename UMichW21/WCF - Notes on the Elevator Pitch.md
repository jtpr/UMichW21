# Elevator Pitch
### What is it
You have 30-45 seconds to convince them you're perfect. It is the *hook* to the rest of your package as an applicant.

### Introduce yourself
- Name, Major, Class level, position you're interested in.

### Why are you interested in the company?
- Why are you talking to them?
	- Heard from a friend
	- Specific projects they did in the past
- Highlight 1-2 skills or experiences **on your resume** related to the position

### Close with why you are well suited for the position and a question.
- Don't go with a "I believe" statement. Assert you would be a great fit.


This begs the question though, [[WCF - Companies Coming|what companies are coming?]].
