# Writing Assignment 1 Notes           

Draft a memorandum to your candidate about the labor market and its relationship to the automation market. Your memo should:
- Discuss the principles that contribute to market equilibrium.
	- Define Market - Place where buyers and sellers come together
	- Define Consumers and Producers
		- Consumer: Purchases goods or services created by the Producer
		- Producer: Sells said good or service. 
	- Demand Relationship
		- The relationship between the quantity of a good available and the price per quantity demanded.
		- The law of demand is that: **as price increases, the quantity demanded decreases** *along a curve*
	- Supply Relationship
		- Also a relationship between the quantity supplied and price demanded. 
		- 
	- The market helps regulate price as the relationship between quantity demanded and quantity supplied comes to an equilibrium. 
- Identify which factors and variables lead to changes in the market.
	- To change the market, a shift in demand or supply can occur
	- Shifting the demand curve (Brand cereal vs generic cereal)
		- Changes in price of related goods
			- Substitutes: If product A falls in price, consumers are less likely to buy B. (Generic is cheaper so less people buy name brand )
			- Complements: Fall in price of one good makes people more willing to buy the other good. (If milk decreases in price, more people may buy more expensive cereal)
		- Changes in Taste
		- Changes in Income
			- Normal goods: More income, more demand
			- Inferior goods: More income, less demand (wonderbread)
		- Changes in Expectations
		- Changes in the Number of Consumers
- Explain, in the context of these principles, how an improvement in the technology within the automation market affects the labor market.
	- Increases the efficiency at which products can be produced -> increases supply which then lowers the price for said good. 
	- As automation increases
- Explain, how the change in the automation market, and its subsequent effect on the labor market, ultimately impact the markets for the goods and services which are produced using labor and automation. (You may treat the markets for the goods and services produced by labor and automation as one market for simplicity.

To Keep in mind
- Assume no economics background. Assume no government intervention.
- Use APA or MLA format if you use external sources
- Class notes are internal sources
- Keep the memo in roughly 250-300 words.
- TNR 12pt. Double Space
- Briefly define new terms you use

Basic Outline
- What is market equilibrium
	- Where the quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equalized at a certain price. 
	- Consumers demand the quantity demanded and producers the quantity supplied.
- How does the respective curves shift?
	- The demand curve set by consumers shifts based on changes in demand
		- Changes in price of related goods
		- Changes in Taste
		- Changes in income
		- Changes in number of consumers
	- The supply curve set by consumers shifts based on changes in supply
		- Change in input prices
		- Chnage in technology ->
		- Change in number of producers -> producers with the ability to automate can outproduce 
- How does automation technology improving affect the labor market?
	- Labor is a unique market. The suppliers are the workers themselves. 
	- More automation means less quantity of workers demanded by firms. Therefore the price of labor falls. 
	- As the demand of labor falls, the supply of labor may also increase, as less people working means that more are looking for work. 
- How does the change in the automation market and therefore the labor market, affect the market for goods and services produced using labor and automation?
	-  As automation increases, this allows the firm to produce more of their good or service. This then lowers the price as the supply increases with the same quantity demanded, leading to a lower price.
	- However, if automation were to become *too* widespread, ordinary workers would experience a fall in average income and may not have enough money to spend on the good or service provided by the firm.
		- These people would then move to consuming inferior goods that are even cheaper.
