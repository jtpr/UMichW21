The equilibrium price can be changed either by the consumers or producers. Consumers change their demand based on a variety of factors. In general demand changes if the good becomes more desirable, or easier to get based on conditions outside the market. These factors can range from changes in taste, income, the price of related goods, or the number of consumers. Suppliers also adjust their supply due to changes outside of the market. These factors include a change in the number of producers, input prices, or the focus of this memo, technology.

In recent years, automation has been able to replace human labor at a blistering pace, this affects the labor market. The labor market is unique, as firms buy labor from the individuals that supply it. One may think that as automation advances, the quantity of human labor demanded falls and lowers the price of labor. However, as examined in Aghion’s 2020 paper, automation can lead to more efficient processes and an increase in supply. This increase in supply then lowers the price for the good and may even increase sales of the good/service, leading to higher profits and a larger scale. This prediction is confirmed in Aghion’s 2020 paper. All these factors combine to a generally positive relationship between employment and automation when viewed at the industry level.

Therefore, automation is, in general, a net positive, even for those jobs immediately cut, as increased profits can lead to a larger scale of operations and increased industry-wide employment.
