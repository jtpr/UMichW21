# L1: About and Intro

## Analytical and Computational Methods
- We are looking for things that don't have an exact answer. 
- Mostly for larger scale problems. 
- Computational methods
	- Simplify complex problems
	- **Approximate the answers** -> control the error and solve large complex problems. 

> Avoid "black box" computing. Existing functions allow you to miss how it works. 

- Create a library of python functions! 

## Mathematical Models
Dependent Variable = f(independent variables, parameters, forcing functions)
- Dependent Variable
	- The behavior / state of the system 
- Independent Variables
	- Dimensions (space and time)
- Parameters
	- Systems proprieties
- Forcing Function
	- external influences on the system.
